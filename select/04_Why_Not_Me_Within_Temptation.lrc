[00:01.73] Some may call it a curse
[00:04.13] A life like mine
[00:06.24] But others, a blessing
[00:09.81] It's certainly a lonely life
[00:13.28] But a fulfilling one at best
[00:16.87] It's my cross to bear
[00:20.23] And I bear it gladly
[00:22.83] Someone has to take a stand against evil
[00:27.32] Why should it not be me?
