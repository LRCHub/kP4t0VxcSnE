[00:01.16] Some may call it a curse
[00:03.69] A life like mine
[00:06.17] But others, a blessing
[00:09.45] It's certainly a lonely life
[00:12.58] But a fulfilling one at best
[00:17.04] It's my cross to bear
[00:19.72] And I bear it gladly
[00:22.92] Someone has to take a stand against evil
[00:27.18] Why should it not be me?
